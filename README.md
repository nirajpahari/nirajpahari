Ph.D. Student @ Kyushu Institute of Technology | [nirajpahari@gmail.com](mailto:nirajpahari@gmail.com)

I am a Ph.D. student at the Shimada Laboratory in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Kyushu Institute of Technology (Kyutech), Fukuoka, Japan, conducting research in Natural Language Processing under the supervision of Prof. Kazutaka SHIMADA. Prior to this, I completed my master's degree from the RAI lab at KMITL in Bangkok, Thailand.

My current research interests lie in active learning and multi-task learning in code-mixed data.
